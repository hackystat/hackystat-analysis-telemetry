Implements telemetry reducer extension point. A telemetry reducer is reponsible for processing raw software
metrics to generate an instance of <code>TelemetryStreamCollection</code>. The input to a
reducer is an array of <code>String</code> objects containing instructions fine tuning reducer
behaviors.
<p/>
This package is part of telemetry infrastructure. It provides a plug-in mechanism whereby new
implementation of reducers can be dynamically added to the system. Within the telemetry 
infrastructure, <code>TelemetryEvaluator</code> uses <code>TelemetryReducerManager</code> 
as a proxy to resolve reducer call.
