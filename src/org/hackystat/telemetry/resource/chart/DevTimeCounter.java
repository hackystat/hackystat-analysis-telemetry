/**
 * Provides a facility for counting up the DevTime associated with a series of timestamps
 * associated with DevEvent sensor data.  
 * The DevTimeCounter partitions a day into 288 five minute intervals.  If at least one 
 * DevEvent timestamp occurs within an interval, that entire five minute interval counts
 * as DevTime.  At any time, the getDevTime() method can be called to find the total 
 * amount of DevTime accumulated so far.   DevTime for a day can range from 0 minutes 
 * to 1440 minutes, in five minute increments. 
 * 
 * Note that the DevTimeCounter looks only at the hours, minutes, and seconds associated with 
 * a timestamp.  The client is responsible for assuring that all of the timestamps are associated
 * with the same day.
