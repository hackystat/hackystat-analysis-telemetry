Provides implementations of "stock", or built-in telemetry functions. Note that 
Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Idempotent funtions are required by telemetry infrastructure 
to work correctly. Thus they are hard-wired into <code>TelemetryfunctionManager</code>
The remaining functions are made available through standard telemetry function
extension mechanism.
