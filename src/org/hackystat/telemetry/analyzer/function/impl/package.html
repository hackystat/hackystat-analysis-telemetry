Provides some stock implementation of telemetry functions. Note that 
Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Idempotent funtions are required by telemetry infrastructure 
to work correctly. Thus they are hard-wired into <code>TelemetryfunctionManager</code>
The rest of the functions are made available through standard telementry function
extension manifest xml file.
