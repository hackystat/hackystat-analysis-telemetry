Provides the implemetation of the  Telemetry Language <em>reducer</em> construct, which 
processes sensor data and 
generates an instance of a TelemetryStreamCollection. The input to a
reducer is an array of <code>String</code> objects representing parameters to modify reducer
behaviors.
<p/>
This package is part of telemetry infrastructure. It provides a plug-in mechanism whereby new
implementations of reducers can be dynamically added to the system. Within the telemetry 
infrastructure, <code>TelemetryEvaluator</code> uses <code>TelemetryReducerManager</code> 
as a proxy to resolve reducer call.
