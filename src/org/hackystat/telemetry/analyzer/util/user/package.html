Implements user management services, including the generation of unique UserKeys for each user and
the storage and retrieval of persistent user-specific properties.
<p>
The user package provides a server-side facility for definition and management of User instances,
each of which corresponds to one registered user (or test user) of Hackystat. The UserManager
class is a singleton that provides access to the set of all User instances. 
Each registered user of the system is represented by exactly one User instance. Each
user is provided with a (usually 12 character) "user key" upon registration, which is generated
by the UserKey class.

<p>
In terms of thread-safety, getJDomDocument and putJDomDocument use synchronization on the
object, while the remaining methods use util.concurrent classes.
