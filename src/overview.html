The DailyProjectData service provides a facility for providing metrics on a specific project
for a specific day.  This is accomplished by obtaining all of the relevent raw sensor data
from the Project members and performing an appropriate computation on it.  The results are then
cached to improve performance of the system. 
<p>
This SensorBase uses the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> framework to support
its REST architectural style.
