The Telemetry service provides a facility for manipulating trends in 
data over time. It is organized into two package hierarchies:

<ul>
<li> org.hackystat.telemetry.analyzer.* contains the implementation of the Telemetry Language.
<li> org.hackystat.telemetry.service.* contains the implementation of the RESTful web service.
</ul>
